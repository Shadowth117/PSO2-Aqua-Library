    /// <summary>
    /// ARC is similar to something like PSO2 NIFL where it's more of a wrapper for other formats. .lnd also uses a variant of this at times.
    /// While some ARC files have named file groups to denote usage, some do not and simply expect to be handled based on their filename pattern.
    /// Here is a rough list of what .arc file does what:
    /// 
    /// ae_  : 2d data. Seems to contain data to assemble and animate the images they contain. At a glance, these vary based on if they contain palette data or not.
    /// ani_ : Egg animal data. These have file groups. _model and _param subcategories are what they sound like. _birth_cam is seemingly the camera data, including pathing, for when egg animals hatch.
    ///             race_red is unclear at this time, though probably a mission race's pathing.
    /// ar_blue_ : Pirate Elder data? Has file groups.
    /// ar_ene_ : Enemy data. 
    /// ar_event_ : In-game cutscene data. Has file groups.
    /// ar_icon3d : Unknown icon data. Has file groups.
    /// ar_ma_ : Item data. Unused. Has file groups.
    /// ar_nowloading : Stub file related to the loading screen. Unclear if it does something at a glance.
    /// ar_obj : Object data for various stages. Same format as ar_ene.
    /// ar_title : Title screen data 
    /// balloon : Unknown data : Has file groups.
    /// battlemodel_ : Battle mode model data
    /// egg_gold : Elder golden egg data : Has file groups.
    /// egg_suit : Legendary chicken suit : Has file groups.
    /// event_ : Level scripting? 
    /// gallery_egg : Data for eggs in the gallery
    /// ge_egg : Egg data. Has file groups.
    /// ge_player : Player character data. Has file groups.
    /// geobj_ : Level geometry objects : Has partial file groups. Some data is listed at the start with counts as to how much of a particular data type is there, followed by pointers to it. 
    ///                                   Following all of this data starts the file group data.
    ///                                   geobj_ that aren't common or a specific stage geobj_ are a different format variation entirely. These object ones ARE file group based with redundant references leading off.
    /// item_ani : Used for item data.
    /// item_cap : Used for cap item data.
    /// item_chickenbomb : What it sounds like.
    /// item_comb : Chicken comb item data.
    /// item_ : All others items work similarly to the above.
    /// lib_ : Gallery data. Same as item_ data in layout and many entries here are identical to that area.
    /// main_menu : Menu data.
    /// menu : Menu data.
    /// obj_ : Various objects and their data. Has file groups.
    /// ptcl2_ : Particle data.
    /// stgobj_ : Stage object data. Pairs with geobj files to define object handling. Has file groups.
    /// storySeq : Story sequence data. Has file groups.
    /// superBilly : Super Billy data. Has file groups.
    /// 
    /// arc type files that aren't .arc:
    /// 
    /// egglevel.bin : Tables for configuring the various eggs. See EggLevel.cs for details.
    /// .lnd : Stage geometry, comes in an ARC and non ARC variant. ARC variant has file groups and is used in the final game. The other variant is seemingly unused in final.
    /// .pad : PArtical Data. Has file groups. ani_ files and some others contain this type of data too.
